Forked from [this repo](https://github.com/altryne/chatGPT-telegram-bot)

[![CleanShot 2022-12-02 at 16 08 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/463317/205404516-56ea908e-dd31-4c53-acb7-15f9f6ed379f.gif)](https://twitter.com/altryne/status/1598822052760195072)

This is a Telegram bot that lets you chat with the [chatGPT](https://github.com/openai/gpt-3) language model using your local browser, and uses the [Carrot](https://www.banana.dev/blog/banana-launches-carrot) model to add image support to chatGPT. The bot uses Playwright to run chatGPT in Chromium, and can parse code and text, as well as send messages. It also includes a `/draw` command that allows you to generate pictures using stable diffusion. More features are coming soon.

## Features

- [ ] Chat with chatGPT from your Telegram on the go
- [ ] Send images to chatGPT and ask questions/talk about the image
- [ ] `/draw` pictures using stable diffusion (version 0.0.2)
- [ ] `/browse` give chatGPT access to Google (version 0.0.3)

## How to Install

### Step 1: Install Python and Miniconda

2. Click on the appropriate installer for your operating system.
3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

### Step 2: Create a conda environment

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the environment.
3. Run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create the environment.
4. Activate the newly created environment `conda activate chat`

### Step 3: Install Playwright

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you installed Miniconda.
3. Run `playwright install` to download the necessary Chromium software.
4. Run `playwright install-deps` to download the necessary dependencies

### Step 4: Set up your Telegram bot

### Step 6: Set up your API keys

1. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename the copy to `.env`.
